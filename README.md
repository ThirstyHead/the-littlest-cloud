# PRESENTATION: The Littlest Cloud: IoT, UPnP, and Mesh Networks

There's a tiny little data cloud following you around wherever you go. Open up iTunes in a crowded coffee shop to see how many others are sharing their music via Bonjour. Wirelessly show pictures from your Smartphone on your SmartTV via Universal Plug 'n Play (UPnP). Stream music throughout your house on a custom mesh network using Sonos speakers.

In this talk, Scott Davis (Principal Engineer with ThoughtWorks) discusses the "Internet" in Internet of Things (IoT), and how many times it doesn't involve the Internet at all. Along the way, you'll see examples of UDP multicasting, service discovery, and all of the clever ways the devices in your life talk about you behind your back.
